.SH DESCRIPTION
.na
Cider is a general purpose programming language.
The source code is available at \fBhttps://github.com/ciderlang/cider\fR.
.P
cider
.B run
will attempt to compose all the phases of compilation, then pass the resulting LLVM code off to
.B clang
to lower it down to machine code and create the final executable binary.
It will then
.B execvp
the built user program and pass along any remaining \fIargs\fR.
.br
.P
cider
.B ll
will emit an LLVM IR file of the
.I program
and its dependencies.
.P
.I program
is resolved by
.B cider
into an actual filename.
When you reference a source file, you can omit the `.cider` extension.
When searching for the specified \fIprogram\fR, \fBcider\fR will look in the current directory first, then proceed to looking through the \fBCIDER_PATH\fR, as described below.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.br
CIDER_ROOT=\fI/usr/local/share/cider\fR
Should point to the base directory for standard runtime and library.
If 
.B CIDER_PATH
is not set, it will default to
.B $CIDER_ROOT/lib
\&. If 
.B CIDER_RUNTIME
is not set, it will default to "
.B $CIDER_ROOT/runtime
\&.
.TP
.br
CIDER_PATH=\fI/usr/local/share/cider/lib\fR
A colon-separated list of directories to search for imported libraries.
Libraries are imported with the `import` keyword.
The `lib/std.cider` library is called the prelude and is automatically imported unless 
.B NO_PRELUDE
is given. Setting this variable overrides the
.B $CIDER_ROOT/lib
location.
.TP
.br
CIDER_RUNTIME=\fI/usr/local/share/cider/runtime\fR
The location of the C-runtime portion of Cider's builtins. See src/cider_rt.c. Setting this variable overrides the
.B $CIDER_ROOT/runtime
location.
.TP
.br
NO_PRELUDE=\fI1\fR
Prevents the automatic import of the `std` library.
This is generally not useful since the language is tied to the runtime library in a few ways.
It comes in handy for writing tests of the compiler itself.
.TP
.br
DEBUG=\fI[0-10]\fR
Sets the level of debugging information to spew.
Default is 0 or none.
Note that
.B cider
must be compiled with
.B \-DCIDER_DEBUG
in order to enable debug logging.
See src/logging.cpp.
.TP
.br
STATUS_BREAK=\fI1\fR
When set to non-zero value,
.B cider
breaks into the debugger at the first user error found (helpful when working on the compiler).
.TP
.br
DUMP_BUILTINS=\fI1\fR
When set to non-zero value,
.B cider
lists all the registered builtin functions and quits.
